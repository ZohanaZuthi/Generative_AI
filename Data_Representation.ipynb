    "Feature extraction is the process of transforming raw data into a set of meaningful attributes or features that can be used for machine learning, data analysis, or pattern recognition. The goal is to extract the most relevant information from the raw data while reducing its complexity, making it easier for algorithms to analyze and process.\n",

Feature extraction helps to identify and isolate the most important aspects of the data that contribute to the task at hand (e.g., classification, regression, clustering).\n"
